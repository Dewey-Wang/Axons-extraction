## **Subdirectory Descriptions**

### **1. Preprocessing**
- Notebook for raw data preprocessing, including denoising, filtering, and preparing data for downstream analysis.

### **2. Manual Labeled Image Correction**
- Tools and scripts for manually correcting labeled images using interactive tools like Napari.

### **3. Semantic Data Generation**
- Notebook for generating semantic labels from ground truth data for model training.

### **4. Data Augmentation**
- Notebook for applying augmentation techniques to increase dataset diversity and robustness.

### **5. Training Data Preparation**
- Notebook for validating, resizing, and patching datasets for model training.

### **6. Model Training**
- Notebooks for training models like 3D-Unet and SM-Unet with detailed hyperparameter configurations.

### **7. Model Evaluation**
- Notebook for evaluating model performance, including metrics like IOU and generating confusion matrices.

### **8. Run the Model**
- Notebooks for performing inference using trained models and analyzing predictions.

### **Utils**
- A collection of modular Python scripts providing shared functionality across the pipeline, such as file handling, patching, and preprocessing utilities.
