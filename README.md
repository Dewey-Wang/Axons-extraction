## Abstract
This thesis focuses on the development of a neural network pipeline designed to automate the identification of axons in mouse spinal cord images. The proposed solution integrates deep learning techniques with advanced image processing, enabling efficient and accurate identification. This work has potential applications in neurobiology, specifically for improving the understanding of spinal cord injuries and axonal behaviors.
